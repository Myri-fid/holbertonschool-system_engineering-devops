Web Infrastructure Basics:

Server: A computer that hosts the website.

Domain Name: The website's address (e.g., www.foobar.com).

DNS Record for www: A record linking the domain name to the server's IP address.

Web Server: Sends website pages to visitors (e.g., Nginx, Apache).

Application Server: Runs the website's code and logic.

Database: Stores site data (e.g., users, content).

Communication with Users: The server uses HTTP/HTTPS to send web pages to a browser.



Potential Issues:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the server crashes, the site goes down.

Downtime for Maintenance: Restarting the server for updates makes the site temporarily unavailable.

Scalability Problems: High traffic can overwhelm the server, slowing or crashing the site.
