Why are these elements added?
Firewalls

Protect the system by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.

SSL Certificate (HTTPS)

Encrypts communication between users and the server, ensuring secure data transfer.

Monitoring Clients

Collect performance data to detect issues early and optimize system health.

Purpose of Each Element
Firewalls prevent unauthorized access and block malicious traffic.

HTTPS (SSL Certificate) ensures encrypted data transfer, protecting user information.

Monitoring Tools collect system logs and analyze performance metrics.

Tracking Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second) helps monitor request rates to prevent overload.

Potential Issues
SSL Termination at Load Balancer

Exposing decrypted traffic internally can reduce security.

Only One MySQL Write Server

A single write database is a failure point, risking data loss.

Identical Components on All Servers

Limits resource optimization, leading to inefficiencies.

Solutions
Secure SSL at the web server level. Add MySQL replication to improve redundancy. Distribute roles for better scalability.
