Why do we add new elements?
Load Balancer (HAProxy)

Spreads traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and improve availability.

Two Servers

Ensures redundancy so if one server fails, the other keeps the website running.

Database Cluster (Primary-Replica)

Improves security and speed by separating data writing and reading.

How does the Load Balancer work?
It distributes requests using different methods:

Round-robin: Sends requests to each server one by one.

Least connections: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.

Active-Active vs Active-Passive
Active-Active: Both servers handle requests at the same time, making the system faster.

Active-Passive: One server is active, and the other is on standby, ready to take over if needed.

How does the database cluster work?
Primary (Master): Handles writing and updates.

Replica (Slave): Copies data from the Primary and handles reading requests.
